# RainText for Android - README

## Overview
This project is an attempt to adapt the RainText desktop application for Android devices. The initial goal was to incorporate the core functionalities of RainText directly into the Android environment. However, due to restrictions and limitations in Android's access policies, it has not been feasible to integrate RainTextCore as initially intended.

## Contribution
We are open to ideas and contributions that could help overcome the current limitations. If you have a viable approach or solution that could make the integration of RainTextCore possible on Android, your input would be highly appreciated. Please feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

## Disclaimer
Please note that the security of the application and the integrity of the data stored within cannot be fully guaranteed by the author. Users should be aware of this consideration and use the application at their own risk.

We encourage community involvement and are eager to see the innovative ways in which RainText can be brought to the Android platform. Your contributions can make a significant difference!
